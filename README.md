# Welcome to the "Virtuoso Summer" Hackathon 2025!

We are aiming for the participation of the entire team - Engineers (FE / BE / SRE), Product Managers, UX. Everyone is encouraged to submit ideas and participate. 
Although a hackathon is always a moment to potentially elevate our product with awesome features, we strongly believe that this is a very important moment for our team and our people. This time we will gather together in Portugal strengthening the team spirit and working deeply on team building.


### Theme / Topic

This time **we will not define a strict topic**, we are counting on your creativity, although we can provide some examples: 
- New features that could provoke the "wow" effect on our customers
- Technical debt that will improve significantly a specific process or workflow
- Improve the resilience of a component / feature
- Improve the CI/CD process:
  - Increasing the coverage of our Inception Tests
  - Increasing the coverage of other type of tests
  - Run Inception Tests at the branch level

### Judgement Criteria

The submissions at the end of the event will be judged based on a variety of factors such as business value and practicality, level of innovation, "wow"-factor, technical achievement/difficulty, and the level of maturity the submission has.
It's very important that all the ideas cover the main benefits and gains that will be uncovered. 

**There will be a prize for the best hackathon project.**

### Venue and communication

We will be holding the event, mainly remotely. There is the possibility of grouping by different locations, but specific details will be shared in the next few weeks.
